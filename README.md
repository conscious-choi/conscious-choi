### Life as an Art

Philosophy, science, literature, engineering, art...
Every creation of mankind may be driven by the quest for a universal truth.

For that enigmatic existence, whether it manifests or not, we each persevere in our respective realms, giving our utmost efforts, today.

Do you perchance know if it shall unveil the answer?

Regardless, the very essence of our lived experience itself is an art form.
