# ***An Art called life***

*Philosophy, art, religion, science, engineering, ...*

*All human-made reasons are ultimately to find a single truth.*

*Someone wants to find out by studying the universe, some people have learned through natural science, and someone else wants to find the answer in religion.*

*What is right? Well, There will be no right and wrong.*

*I just try to find from consciousness, and neuroscience inspired artificial intelligence.*

*All opinions and ideas are welcome.*

*Thank you.*
